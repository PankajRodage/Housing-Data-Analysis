# Project Title: Housing-Data-Analysis

# Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to analyze a comprehensive dataset of housing data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations between various factors that influence housing prices.
The project aims to provide insights into the housing market, helping stakeholders make informed decisions about investments, policy-making, and urban planning.

# Table of Contents:
1. Data Exploration: Explore the housing dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify correlations, and detect outliers.
2. Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing ones to improve model performance and provide additional insights.
3. Modeling: Develop and evaluate multiple machine learning models to predict housing prices based on various factors.
4. Model Evaluation: Compare the performance of different models and identify the best-performing one.
5. Visualization: Create interactive visualizations to communicate findings and insights to stakeholders.
