# Project Title
# Housing-Data-Analysis

# Project Overview
The Housing Data Analysis project explores housing market data to uncover insights related to housing prices, market trends, and influential factors.
This analysis uses a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques to visualize trends, clean and preprocess data, and develop predictive models to forecast housing prices.

# Motivation
The housing market is complex and dynamic, influenced by numerous factors such as economic conditions, location, and property features. This project was created to provide a comprehensive understanding of these factors and their impact on housing prices, helping buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions.

# Features
Data Cleaning: Processes to handle missing values, remove outliers, and standardize data formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand distributions and relationships.
Predictive Modeling: Development of models like Linear Regression and Decision Trees to predict housing prices.
Visualization: Interactive and static plots to illustrate key findings and trends.
